# Text-to-Craft

![alt text](demo.gif)

Welcome to **Text to Craft**, where your imagination becomes a reality! This project uses GPT-powered AI to transform your textual descriptions into virtual structures. Based on Minecraft, it allows users to build with materials like wood, cobblestone, and glass, but with the freedom to add any other materials you desire.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Describe what you want to build in simple words, and the AI will understand and create it for you.
- **Customizable Materials**: Start with basic materials like wood, cobblestone, and glass, and easily add any other materials you want.
- **Next.js Framework**: Built with the powerful Next.js framework for a smooth and responsive user experience.
